    <h2 class="last-first-of-type">What is a verb?</h2>
    
    <p>A <b>verb</b> in English is an action word! It tells you what someone or something is doing, or what happens. <b>Verbs</b> are like the movie stars of a sentence ‚Äì they show the action! Here's how <b>verbs</b> work:</p>

      <ul class="list-square">

        <li><b>Moving and Doing: Verbs</b> can describe actions that people do, like "run," "jump," "sing," or "talk."</li>

        <li><b>Making Things Happen: Verbs</b> can also describe things that happen, like "rain," "grow," "shine," or "explode" (fireworks, not you!).</li>

        <li><b>Being Words Too:</b> Some <b>verbs</b> describe states of being, like "sleep," "sit," "think," or "want."</li>

      </ul>

    <p>Here are some clues to help you identify <b>verbs:</b></p>

      <ul class="list-square">

        <li><b>The "Ing" Test:</b> Sometimes (but not always!), adding "ing" to the end of a word can make it a <b>verb</b> (run -> running, jump -> jumping).</li>

        <li><b>Question Time!: Verbs</b> can often answer the question "what is happening?" For example, "The cat is jumping" (jumping is the <b>verb</b>).</li>

      </ul>

    <p>Here's why <b>verbs</b> are important in English:</p>

      <ul class="list-square">

        <li><b>Action Heroes!: Verbs</b> bring sentences to life! They tell you what's going on and make your sentences more interesting.</li>

        <li><b>Storytelling Stars: Verbs</b> are essential for telling stories. They show what the characters are doing and how the story unfolds.</li>

      </ul>

    <p>Learning <b>verbs</b> is a fun way to build your English vocabulary and become a storytelling pro! Here are some ways to practice:</p>

      <ul class="list-square">

        <li><b>Simon Says!:</b> Play Simon Says with a friend, but instead of just movements, use <b>verbs</b>! Take turns saying things like "Simon says jump" or "Simon says clap."</li>

        <li><b>Act It Out!:</b> Grab a book with pictures and take turns acting out the <b>verbs</b> you see. Can you hop like the bunny or swing like the monkey?</li>

        <li><b>Make a Story Train!:</b> Start a story with a friend. Take turns adding sentences, each with a <b>verb</b>, to build a funny story together!</li>

      </ul>

    <h3 class="last-first-of-type">üåª Think simply!</h3>

    <p>A <b>verb</b> in English is like an action word super power! It tells you what someone or something is doing, like running, jumping, or playing. <b>Verbs</b> are the stars of a sentence because they show what's happening! Here's how <b>verb</b> super powers work:</p>

      <ul class="list-square">

        <li><b>Moving and Doing!: Verb</b> super powers can describe things people do, like your super jump or your super fast run. They can also be for things you do with your friends, like sing or talk.</li>

        <li><b>Making Things Happen!: Verb</b> super powers can describe things that happen around you, like rain falling from the sky or flowers growing in the garden. They can even describe exciting things, like fireworks exploding (but remember, fireworks are for grown-ups to use safely!).</li>

        <li><b>Being Words Too!:</b> Some <b>verb</b> super powers describe how someone is feeling, like feeling happy or sleepy.</li>
