    <h2 class="margin-y-50 text-center">What is an adjective?</h2>

    <p>An <strong>adjective</strong> in English is a describing word! It helps you tell more about the nouns (people, places, things) in your sentence. <strong>Adjectives</strong> are like fancy paintbrushes that add color and details to your words. Here's how <strong>adjectives</strong> work:</p>

      <ul class="list-square">

        <li><strong>Painting a Picture</strong>: <strong>Adjectives</strong> can describe how something looks (color, size, shape), like "red," "big," or "round."</li>

        <li><strong>Feeling the Feels</strong>: They can describe how something feels (texture, temperature), like "soft," "cold," or "bumpy."</li>

        <li><strong>Being More Specific</strong>: They can describe how something is (condition, quality), like "happy," "clean," or "new."</li>

      </ul>

    <p>Here are some clues to help you identify <strong>adjectives</strong>:</p>

      <ul class="list-square">

        <li><strong>Describing Words</strong>: <strong>Adjectives</strong> usually come before the noun they describe (red car, big house, happy dog).</li>

        <li><strong>Answering the Question</strong>: They can sometimes answer the question "what kind of?" For example, "What kind of car?" (Red is the <strong>adjective</strong>).</li>

      </ul>

    <p>Here's why <strong>adjectives</strong> are important in English:</p>

      <ul class="list-square">

        <li><strong>Colorful Sentences</strong>!: <strong>Adjectives</strong> make your sentences more interesting and colorful. They help the listener paint a picture in their mind.</li>

        <li><strong>Details Make the Story</strong>: By using <strong>adjectives</strong>, you can add details to your stories and descriptions, making them more fun and engaging.</li>

      </ul>

    <p>Learning <strong>adjectives</strong> is a fun way to build your English vocabulary and become a descriptive master! Here are some ways to practice:</p>

      <ul class="list-square">

        <li><strong>I Spy! Colors</strong>: Play "I Spy" with a friend, but instead of just the object, describe its color! For example, "I spy with my little eye something big and red" (red ball).</li>

        <li><strong>Feeling Game</strong>: Blindfold a friend and have them feel different objects. Then, take turns describing those objects using <strong>adjectives</strong> (soft, smooth, cold).</li>

        <li><strong>Silly Story Time</strong>: Start a story with a friend. Take turns adding sentences, each with an <strong>adjective</strong> describing a person, place, or thing, to build a funny story together!</li>

      </ul>

    <p class="margin-bottom-50">There are all sorts of <strong>adjectives</strong> in English, so the more you practice, the easier it will be to find them and use them in your own speaking and writing!</p>

    <p>An <strong>adjective</strong> in English is like a glitter word! It adds sparkle and details to the things you talk about, like your toys, friends, or even the weather. Here's how glitter words work:</p>

      <ul class="list-square">

        <li><strong>Sparkly Colors</strong>!: Glitter words can describe how something looks, like its color (sparkly, blue, yellow), size (big, small, giant), or shape (round, square, funny).</li>

        <li><strong>Touchy-Feely Words</strong>: They can describe how something feels, like soft (like your teddy bear), cold (like ice cream), or bumpy (like the sidewalk).</li>

        <li><strong>Special Words Too</strong>: Glitter words can also describe how something is, like happy (like you at playtime), clean (like your room after picking up), or new (like your favorite shoes).</li>

      </ul>

    <p>Here are some tricks to find glitter words:</p>

      <ul class="list-square">

        <li><strong>Before the Noun</strong>: Glitter words usually love to cuddle up right before the noun they describe (sparkly dress, big truck, happy dog).</li>

        <li><strong>What Kind</strong>? <strong>Game</strong>: If you can answer the question "what kind of?" with the word, it's probably a glitter word! For example, "What kind of dress?" (Sparkly is the glitter word).</li>

      </ul>

    <p>Glitter words are important because:</p>

      <ul class="list-square">
