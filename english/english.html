    <h2 class="last-first-of-type">What is English?</h2>
    
    <p><b>English</b> is a West Germanic language that originated from the Anglo-Frisian dialects brought to Britain by Germanic invaders from what is now northwestern Germany, southern Denmark and the Netherlands. The language has evolved over more than 1,400 years, and its development is generally divided into three major periods: Old <b>English</b>, Middle <b>English</b>, and Modern <b>English</b>.</p>

    <p><b>English</b> is now the global lingua franca, a common language used by people who speak different native languages. It's the official language in nearly 60 sovereign states and is used widely in international communication, science, business, aviation, entertainment, and diplomacy.</p>

    <p>Key Characteristics of <b>English</b></p>

      <ul class="list-square">

        <li><b>Vast Vocabulary</b>: <b>English</b> has one of the largest vocabularies of any language, with words borrowed from many other languages, particularly French, Latin, and Greek. This makes it a very flexible and expressive language.</li>

        <li><b>Simple Inflection</b>: Unlike many other languages, <b>English</b> has relatively simple grammar. For example, nouns have very little inflection (changes in form to show grammar), and verbs have fewer conjugations (changes to show tense, person, etc.) than in languages like Spanish or French.</li>

        <li><b>Flexible Word Order</b>: While the basic word order is Subject-Verb-Object (SVO), <b>English</b> is a very flexible language, and the word order can be changed for emphasis or style.</li>

        <li class="last-of-type"><b>Sound and Pronunciation</b>: <b>English</b> has a complex sound system with many different vowel and consonant sounds. Some sounds, like the "th" sound, are not found in many other languages.</li>

      </ul>
