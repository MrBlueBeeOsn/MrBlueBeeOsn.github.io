The structure is: If + Past Perfect (had taken), S + would have + Past Participle (would have been)."},{id:3,question:"Neither the students nor the teacher _______ ready for the presentation yet.",options:["are","is","were","have been"],correctAnswer:1,explanation:'In structures using "neither... nor," the verb must agree with the closest subject (the one immediately before the verb). Since "the teacher" is singular, the singular verb "is" is correct.'},{id:4,question:"Sarah told me that she _______ finished the report the day before.",options:["has","have","had","would"],correctAnswer:2,explanation:'This is an example of Reported Speech. When reporting a past simple or present perfect statement, the tense shifts one step back into the Past Perfect Tense (had finished). "The day before" also signals this shift.'},{id:5,question:"The ancient monument _______ by thousands of tourists every year.",options:["visits","is visiting","is visited","has visited"],correctAnswer:2,explanation:'The subject "The ancient monument" performs the action of being visited, making this a Passive Voice sentence.

We also use "the" to refer to specific, known locations like "the coast of California."'},{id:9,question:"My flight was delayed, so I had to ______ a new ticket.",options:["check in","turn off","look after","book"],correctAnswer:3,explanation:'The correct verb related to purchasing or reserving a travel ticket is "to book" (or to reserve).
