The structure is If + Simple Past, would + Base Verb. When using the verb "to be" in the if-clause for hypothetical situations, we generally use "were" for all subjects (including I, he, she, it).'},{id:2,question:"She looks forward to ______ her grandparents next month.",options:["visit","visiting","visited","be visiting"],correctAnswer:1,explanation:'The phrase "look forward to" is a common expression where the word "to" is a preposition, not part of an infinitive. Therefore, it must be followed by a gerund (the -ing form of a verb).'},{id:3,question:"Neither John ______ Mark was available to help.",options:["or","nor","and","but"],correctAnswer:1,explanation:'The correlative conjunction pair "Neither... nor" is used to connect two negative ideas, meaning "not one and not the other" when referring to two people or things.'},{id:4,question:"This is the house ______ I grew up.",options:["who","which","where","what"],correctAnswer:2,explanation:'"Where" is a relative adverb used to introduce a relative clause that modifies a noun referring to a place (the house). "Which" is a relative pronoun and would require a preposition (e.g., in which or where).'},{id:5,question:"By the time the police arrived, the thieves ______ already left.",options:["have","had","were","are"],correctAnswer:1,explanation:"This sentence requires the Past Perfect tense (had + past participle) to describe an action (leaving) that was completed before another action in the past (the police arrived)."},{id:6,question:"He suggested ______ to the park for a walk.",options:["going","to go","go","went"],correctAnswer:0,explanation:'The verb "suggest" is one of the verbs that is typically followed by a gerund (the -ing form of the verb). It cannot be followed directly by an infinitive (to go).'},{id:7,question:"How ______ money do you need to buy a new car?",options:["much","many","a lot","few"],correctAnswer:0,explanation:'"Money" is an uncountable noun in English. We use "much" with uncountable nouns in questions and negative statements.'},{id:8,question:"The book ______ on the table belongs to my teacher.",options:["lay","laying","lie","lying"],correctAnswer:3,explanation:'"Lying" is the present participle of the verb "to lie" (meaning to rest or be in a flat position). It is used here as part of a reduced relative clause (which is lying).'},{id:9,question:"If the weather ______ good, we will go hiking.",options:["is","was","were","has been"],correctAnswer:0,explanation:"This is an example of the First Conditional (real or possible future situation). The structure requires the Simple Present tense (is) in the if-clause and will + base verb in the main clause."},{id:10,question:"The company will provide ______ necessary training.",options:["an","a","the","∅ (no article)"],correctAnswer:2,explanation:'We use the definite article "the" because the training being referred to is specific. It is the particular training that is necessary for the job or context.'}];return e.jsx("main",{className:"image image2",children:e.jsxs("article",{children:[e.jsx("h4",{children:e.jsx(n,{smooth:!0,to:"/english#grammar-basic-practice",children:e.jsx("mark",{className:"highlight-tertiary-padding-4-8",children:"Grammar"})})}),e.jsxs("header",{className:"quiz-header",children:[e.jsx("h1",{className:"margin-y-50 text-center",children:"English Grammar Questions"}),e.jsx("p",{className:"subtitle text-center",children:"Test your knowledge of fundamental English grammar concepts"})]}),e.jsx(i,{questions:t}),e.jsx("div",{className:"viewcounter",children:e.jsx("div",{className:"post-date no-margin",children:e.jsx("span",{children:"December 10, 2025 · by 💎Gem ·"})})})]})})}export{s as default};
