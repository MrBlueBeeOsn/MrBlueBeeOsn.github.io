    <h2 className="margin-y-50 text-center">What is an adverb?</h2>

    {/* This is the content of English Learning Term. */}

    <p>An <strong>adverb</strong> in English is a word that adds more details to verbs (action words), adjectives (describing words), or even other <strong>adverbs</strong>! It's like a super tiny helper word that gives you extra information about how, when, where, why, or how much something happens.</p>

    <p className="margin-top-20">Here's how <strong>adverbs</strong> work:</p>

      <ul className="list-square">

        <li><strong>Helping Verbs<strong>: </strong>Adverbs</strong> can help verbs by telling you how something happens. For example, "The cat ran quickly" (quickly tells how the cat ran).</li>

        <li><strong>Helping Adjectives</strong>: <strong>Adverbs</strong> can help adjectives by describing the intensity of something. For example, "The soup was very hot" (very describes how hot the soup was).</li>

        <li><strong>Helping Other Adverbs</strong>: <strong>Adverbs</strong> can even help other <strong>adverbs</strong>! For example, "She walked incredibly slowly" (incredibly describes how slowly she walked).</li>

      </ul>

    <p className="margin-top-20">Here are some clues to help you identify <strong>adverbs</strong>:</p>

      <ul className="list-square">

        <li><strong>Spot the</strong> "<strong>ly</strong>" <strong>Ending</strong>: Many <strong>adverbs</strong> end in "ly" (quickly, happily, carefully). However, not all words ending in "ly" are <strong>adverbs</strong> (friendly, lively, lonely).</li>

        <li><strong>Question Time</strong>: <strong>Adverbs</strong> can sometimes answer questions like "how?" "when?" "where?" "why?" or "how much?" For example, "How did the cat run?" (quickly).</li>

      </ul>

    <p className="margin-top-20">Here's why <strong>adverbs</strong> are important in English:</p>

      <ul className="list-square">

        <li><strong>Sentence Superchargers</strong>!: <strong>Adverbs</strong> add extra details to your sentences, making them more interesting and informative.</li>

        <li><strong>Painting a Clear Picture</strong>: By using <strong>adverbs</strong>, you can paint a clearer picture in the listener's mind of what you're trying to say.</li>

      </ul>

    <p className="margin-top-20">Learning <strong>adverbs</strong> is a fun way to build your English vocabulary and become a super descriptive speaker! Here are some ways to practice:</p>

      <ul className="list-square">

        <li><strong>Silly Walk Race</strong>: Have a silly walk race with a friend! See who can walk the funniest way, then describe each other's walks using <strong>adverbs</strong> (wobbly, tippy-toe, super slow).</li>

        <li><strong>Adverb Hunt</strong>: Read a book together and look for <strong>adverbs</strong>! Can you find <strong>adverbs</strong> that tell you how, when, where, or why something happened?</li>

        <li><strong>Story Chain</strong>: Start a story with a friend. Take turns adding sentences, each with an <strong>adverb</strong> describing how something happened, to build a funny story together!</li>

      </ul>

    <p className="margin-top-20">There are all sorts of <strong>adverbs</strong> in English, so the more you practice, the easier it will be to find them and use them to add extra details to your speaking and writing!</p>

    <p>An <strong>adverb</strong> in English is like a tiny whisper word that helps your other words tell a clearer story. Here's how it works:</p>

      <ul className="list-square">

        <li><strong>Helping Action Words</strong>: Imagine you're telling a story about your toy car. An <strong>adverb</strong> can whisper how the car moved. You could say, "The car zoomed quickly" (quickly whispers how the car zoomed).</li>

        <li><strong>Helping Describing Words</strong>: Maybe you have a giant stuffed bear. An <strong>adverb</strong> can whisper how big it is. You could say, "My bear is very big" (very whispers how big the bear is).</li>

        <li><strong>Whispering to Other Whispers</strong>: Sometimes <strong>adverbs</strong> even whisper to other whispering words! You could say, "The turtle walked incredibly slowly" (incredibly whispers how slowly, which is already whispering how the turtle walked).</li>

      </ul>

    <p className="margin-top-20">Here are some tricks to find these whispering words:</p>

      <ul className="list-square">

        <li><strong>Listen for the</strong> "<strong>ly</strong>" <strong>Sound</strong>: Many <strong>adverbs</strong>, but not all, like to wear tiny capes that sound like "ly" at the end (quickly, happily, carefully).</li>

        <li><strong>Asking Questions</strong>: <strong>Adverbs</strong> can answer special questions like "how?" "when?" "where?" "why?" or "how much?" For instance, "How did the car move?" (quickly).</li>

      </ul>

      <h4 className="margin-y-50 text-center">Why are adverbs important?</h4>
      
      <p>Because:</p>

      <ul className="list-square">

        <li><strong>Supercharged Sentences</strong>!: <strong>Adverbs</strong> give your sentences extra power by adding more details. They make your stories even more exciting!</li>

        <li><strong>Clear Pictures</strong>!: By using <strong>adverbs</strong>, you help your friend see exactly what you're trying to tell them, like how fast your car zoomed or how big your bear is.</li>

      </ul>

    <p className="margin-top-20">Learning <strong>adverbs</strong> is like a whispering treasure hunt! Here are some ways to play and learn:</p>

      <ul className="list-square">

        <li><strong>Silly Sound Walk</strong>: Take a walk with a friend and see who can walk in the silliest way. Then whisper how you walked (waddled, tippy-toed, super slow).</li>

        <li><strong>Adverb Adventure</strong>: Read a book together and hunt for whispering words! Can you find <strong>adverbs</strong> that answer "how?" "when?" or "where?"</li>

        <li><strong>Story Time Whispers</strong>: Start a story with a friend. Take turns adding sentences, each with a whispering word to describe how something happened, to build a super silly story together!</li>

      </ul>
