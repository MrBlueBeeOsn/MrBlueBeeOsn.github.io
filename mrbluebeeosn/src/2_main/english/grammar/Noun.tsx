      {/* This is the content of English Learning Term. */}

      <p>A <strong>noun</strong> in English is a word that names a person, place, thing, or idea. It's like a super identifier that helps you tell people and things apart!</p>

      <p className="margin-top-20">Here's how nouns work:</p>
      
        <ul className="list-square">

          <li><strong>People and Places</strong>: <strong>Nouns</strong> can be the names of people, like "teacher," "friend," or "mom." They can also be the names of places, like "park," "school," or "beach."</li>

          <li><strong>Things You Can See and Touch</strong>: <strong>Nouns</strong> can name things you can see and touch, like "cat," "ball," or "book."</li>

          <li><strong>Big Ideas Too</strong>!: <strong>Nouns</strong> can even name ideas that you can't see or touch, like "happiness," "love," or "freedom."</li>

        </ul>
      
      <p className="margin-top-20">Here are some clues to help you identify <strong>nouns</strong>:</p>
      
        <ul className="list-square">
          
          <li><strong>The</strong> "<strong>A</strong>" <strong>Test</strong>: You can often try putting "the" in front of the word. If it sounds right, it's probably a <strong>noun</strong> (the cat, the teacher, the beach).</li>

          <li><strong>Question Time</strong>: <strong>Nouns</strong> can answer the questions "who?" or "what?" For example, "Who is your teacher?" (Teacher is the <strong>noun</strong>) or "What is on the table?" (Table is the noun).</li>

        </ul>
      
      <p className="margin-top-20">Here's why <strong>nouns</strong> are important in English:</p>
      
        <ul className="list-square">

          <li><strong>Building Blocks</strong>: <strong>Nouns</strong> are like the building blocks of sentences! They tell you who or what the sentence is about.</li>

          <li><strong>Playing with Words</strong>: Knowing your <strong>nouns</strong> helps you play with language and express yourself clearly. You can use different <strong>nouns</strong> to create different pictures in your listener's mind.</li>

        </ul>
      
      <p className="margin-top-20">Learning <strong>nouns</strong> is a fun way to start building your English vocabulary! Here are some ways to practice:</p>
      
        <ul className="list-square">

          <li><strong>I Spy</strong>!: Play "I Spy" with a friend and take turns finding things around you and saying their names (<strong>nouns</strong>).</li>

          <li><strong>Noun Hunt</strong>: Go on a <strong>noun</strong> hunt in a book or magazine! See how many people, places, and things you can find.</li>

          <li><strong>Make a List</strong>: Choose a topic you like, like animals or toys, and write down all the <strong>nouns</strong> you can think of that relate to that topic.</li>

        </ul>
      
      <p className="margin-top-20"><strong>Nouns</strong> are everywhere in English, so the more you practice, the easier it will be to identify them and use them in your own speaking and writing!</p>

      <p>A <strong>noun</strong> in English is like a special word tag! It helps you name all sorts of things, like people, places, toys, and even feelings! Nouns are like the building blocks of sentences, and they help us understand what we're talking about.</p>
      
      <p className="margin-top-20">Here are some fun things that can be <strong>nouns</strong>:</p>
      
        <ul className="list-square">

          <li><strong>People</strong>: This tag can be for your friends (like "Sofia") or grown-ups (like "teacher").</li>

          <li><strong>Places</strong>: This tag can be for fun places like the "park" or your cozy "home."</li>

          <li><strong>Things You Can See</strong>: This tag can be for things you hold, like your favorite "ball," or things you see, like a fluffy "cloud."</li>

          <li><strong>Feelings Too</strong>!: This tag can even be for things you can't hold, but you can feel, like happy "laughter" or silly "giggles."</li>

        </ul>
      
      <p className="margin-top-20">Here are some super easy tricks to find <strong>nouns</strong>:</p>
      
        <ul className="list-square">

          <li><strong>The</strong> "<strong>The</strong>" <strong>Test</strong>: Say "the" before the word. If it sounds right (like "the cat," "the swing"), it's probably a <strong>noun</strong>!</li>

          <li><strong>Who</strong>? <strong>What</strong>? <strong>Game</strong>: If you can answer "who?" or "what?" with the word, it's a <strong>noun</strong>! For example, "Who is your friend?" (Friend is the <strong>noun</strong>) or "What do you play with?" (Ball is the <strong>noun</strong>).</li>

        </ul>
      
      <p className="margin-top-20"><strong>Nouns</strong> are super important because:</p>
